ducking-octo-hipster
====================

random stuff which doesn't have its own project/repo. github "inspired" the "short and memorable" name. What I mean by that is if you go to create a repo on GitHub, it starts with an empty repo name box and says "Need inspiration? Try ducking-octo-hipster" or similar. If you reload the page you get a different suggestion. I just explained that because the repository name really is pretty senseless.
